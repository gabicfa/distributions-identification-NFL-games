## Distributions Identification
Analysis of the NFL game data sample. Frequency of results in games


## Objective
This project aims to identify which distributions (probability density functions - in the continuous case, or probability functions - in the discrete case) describe the quantitative variables extracted from datasets well. The result is a report that identifies, with good arguments, probabilistic models for two quantitative variables from one or more datasets.
